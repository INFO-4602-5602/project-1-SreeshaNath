<h1>Project 1: Visualizing Anscombeâ€™s Quartet</h1>

Since the css did not work through the link tag, I added all the css to the head of the html.
I have created a separate file for the d3 javascript content except for the javascript related to the menu for the whistle:transitions. Implemented the first 5 parts as asked by creating a separate div for each part so that there is clarity.

<h2>Bells & Whistles: </h2>

<h3>Bell: Tooltips</h3>
Implemented with part 2. Added a tooltip with a background and rounded the edges of the tooltip as a part of stlying the visualization. 

<h3>Bell: Xs and Ys</h3>
Created side by side bar charts for the dataset.

<h3>Bell: Styling your Visualization</h3>
I decided to go with a "blackboard&chalk" theme. To do so, added a blackboard image for a background. Changed the color of the axes to white and added colors to the plots.

<h3>Bell: Best Fit Lines</h3>
I used an online resource for the basics on calculating the best fit line. The line comes close to the expected one but isnt the absolutely correct one.  

<h3>Whistle: Transitions </h3>
I have added a drop down menu to choose different datasets. The plot changes as you choose different datasets. 

<h3>Whistle: Replication</h3>
replicated using tableau. The image is named AnscombeQuartets.jpeg 

<h3>Whistle: Coordinated Views</h3>
The side by side bar charts created in Bell: Xs and Ys are linked to highlight the corresponding bars in both the plot when you hover over the bars.
